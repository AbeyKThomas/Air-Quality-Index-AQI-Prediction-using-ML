# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Prediction-using-ML
In this project we are comparing various machine learning models to find which model works better for predicting the Air Quality Index(AOI).

# Data Source
The data set is taken from Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India. The site provides Real time National Air Quality Index values from different monitoring stations across India. The pollutants monitored are so2 (sulphur dioxide concentration), no2 (nitrogen dioxide concentration), rspm (respirable suspended particualte matter concentration), spm (suspended particulate matter) and pm2_5 (particulate matter 2.5) .


# Machine learning models used

In this project we are using regression models such as:

Multiple Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression


In this project we are using classification models such as:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbours




# Metrics Used
In this project we have used the following error metrics to evaluate and compare our models:


Mean Square Error (MSE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Mean absolute error (MAE)
Coefficient of determination (R^2)


accuracy_score
confusion_matrix
